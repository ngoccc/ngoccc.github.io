<p>
Hello! My name is <b>Bich Ngoc Doan</b>, but I usually go by <b>Rubi</b>. I'm currently a visiting researcher in <a href="https://www.socialai.studio/" target="_blank">Social AI Studio @ SUTD</a>, and a M.S. student in <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/digital-humanities/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities @ EPFL</a>. Previously, I got my B.S. degree from the <a href="https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">School of Computing @ KAIST</a>, where I worked in several HCI and social computing labs, most recently with <a href="https://joseph.seering.org/index.html" target="_blank">Professor Joseph Seering</a> at <a href="http://cstlab.org" target="_blank">CSTL</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research lies at the intersection of <b>Human–Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing, and Computational Social Science</b>. I’m broadly interested in understanding how people interact in online spaces and how computational methods—especially large language models—can help analyze, interpret, and support healthier digital communities. I enjoy exploring both <b>tool-building for user engagement and large-scale data analysis</b> to uncover social patterns and inform policy and design.
</p>

<p>
Outside of research and study, I enjoy spending my free time pursuing creative hobbies such as drawing, cooking, and crocheting. I find immense joy in crafting things with my own hands, and I'm always eager to explore new creative outlets and ideas!

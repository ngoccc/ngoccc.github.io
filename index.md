<p>
Hello! My name is <b>Bich Ngoc Doan</b>, but I usually go by <b>Rubi</b> 💎. I'm a first-year Master's student in <a id="blue-bg" href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/digital-humanities/">Digital Humanities @ EPFL</a>. Previously, I got my Bachelor's degree from the <a id="blue-bg" href="https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/">School of Computing @ KAIST</a>. During my study, I was part of several research labs as a research assistant.
My latest experience was at <a id="blue-bg" href="http://cstlab.org">CSTL</a>, where I was advised by <a id="blue-bg" href="https://joseph.seering.org/index.html">Professor Joseph Seering</a>. Currently I'm looking for a new research assistant position at EPFL!

</p>

<p>
My research interest lies in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Social Computing. In particular, I want to study and explore ways to build <b>inclusive online spaces that are safe, engaging, and supportive for diverse stakeholders</b>. Recently, I have also become interested in Computational Social Media, particularly in <b>managing online content at scale and extracting meaningful insights from user interactions</b>.
</p>

<p>
Outside of research and study, I enjoy spending my free time pursuing creative hobbies such as drawing, cooking, and crocheting. I find immense joy in crafting things with my own hands, and I'm always eager to explore new creative outlets and ideas!
